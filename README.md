# Alcohol tracker and BAC estimator

This is a small in-browser app that lets you track your drinks easily and quickly, and provides an estimate of your BAC.

It's an estimate only and may not be accurate.

You can use the app at https://dylandhall.github.io/AlcoholTracker/ - it uses your local storage to save any changes so you won't lose your drinks and settings if you reload the page.

This means it won't sync between devices, but it does mean you don't have to sign up for an account!
